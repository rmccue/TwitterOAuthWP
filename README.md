# TwitterOAuthWP

This class is a simple implementation of the WP HTTP API for [@abraham's
awesome OAuth library](https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth), based
on a comment made during a WordCamp Gold Coast session.

## How to use:

1. Include @abraham's library into your code
2. Include this class
3. Wherever you'd usually write `TwitterOAuth`, instead write
   `TwitterOAuthWP`.

It's that easy.
